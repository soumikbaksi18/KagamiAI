# KAGAMI: The Future of Social Copy Trading

## 🎯 **The Problem** 

**Traditional DeFi trading is broken for 95% of users:**
- **Complex & Intimidating**: Most users struggle with DeFi protocols, slippage, and gas optimization
- **No Social Layer**: Traders operate in isolation without learning from successful strategies
- **Poor UX**: Fragmented tools, confusing interfaces, and steep learning curves
- **Manual Everything**: No automation for recurring strategies or copy trading
- **High Barriers**: Requires deep technical knowledge and constant monitoring

**The result?** Billions in potential DeFi value locked away from everyday users who want to participate but don't know how.
